# wasabi_boombox

This resource was created as a free portable boombox script capable of playing youtube links.

I'm aware that the outdated version of nh-context and nh-keyboard are being used in this. I'll update when I do for my personal server or if I get a chance. Until then someone else is more than welcome to make a PR.
